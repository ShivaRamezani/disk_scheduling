# disk_scheduling

 
Objective: 
• To compare the performance of disk scheduling algorithms: 
First-in-first-out (FIFO), Shortest-seek-time-first (SSTF), Scan, and C-Scan. 
 
 
Specification: 
• The program compares the disk scheduling algorithms: First-in-first-out (FIFO), Shortest-
seek-time-first (STTF), Scan, and C-Scan in terms of traversing a set of tracks input by 
the user, and calculates the total distance of the tracks traversed.  
• A menu controls the operations, and each choice calls the appropriate procedure, where 
the choices are:  
1) Enter parameters 
2) Calculate distance to traverse tracks using FIFO 
3) Calculate distance to traverse tracks using SSTF  
4) Calculate distance to traverse tracks using Scan 
5) Calculate distance to traverse tracks using C-Scan 
6) Quit program and free memory
